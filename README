Live Space Package Mover

Missed the deadline for migrating Microsoft Live Space blog to WordPress. Luckily I downloaded the backup file from Live Space.

But when I tried to import the backup file into my own wordpress blog, I found it is impossible. And wordpress.com had already removed the official convertor.

Then I wrote this project, hope it is still useful for many people.

If you still don't have the backup file of your Live Space blog, please go the following forum to get it:
Windows Live Solution Center: Downloading or Migrating your Space http://windowslivehelp.com/forums.aspx?forumid=0568e260-2dae-4115-b574-f8629d8be5b4

This project is based on Qt 4.7.3 and later.

You can download the Qt libs for your platforms here:
http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/downloads#qt-lib

Yes, to build this project, you also need a compiler for your platforms. 

For example, 
Windows 7 -> MSVC 2008 or etc. 
Mac OS X -> XCode(g++ is inside of it). 
Linux -> g++

Build it:
qmake
make // or nmake for MSVC

Use it:
Uncompress your Live Space blog backup package file, and put it into a folder under your web server. For example,
http://www.yourdomain.com/lsp_folder/
./live-space-package-mover http://www.yourdomain.com/lsp_folder/

After a while, you will get a output_yyyymmdd-hhmm.xml. You can go to your wordpress blog admin pages, "Tools"->"Import", and choose "WordPress", click "Choose File" and choose the above generated file, and click "Upload file and import". It will be fine. All posts and comments will be imported.

Issues:
1. After this import, all images in your blogs are still point to http://www.yourdomain.com/lsp_folder/img, you could either keep it or manually put them into your wordpress blog media library and update the links to them.
2. Looks like the "category" doesn't work.

Good luck!
